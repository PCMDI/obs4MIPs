*Work in progress*

CMIP model output is made available via the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl) along with data from other projects including some obs4MIPs.    
Obs4MIPs data published on ESGF is [currently available](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/obs4MIPs/) as a companion project of CMIP or via a new interface [Metagrid-beta](https://aims2.llnl.gov/metagrid/search?project=obs4MIPs)). Currently, efforts are underway to introduce new datasets to obs4MIPs as well as to update existing products.  ESGF is a primary platform for making many obs4MIPs data available and additionally some obs4MIPs compliant datasets may exist or be available via other pathways.
