# The Climate Forecast Metadata Conventions

The CF metadata conventions provide standards for the description of climate and weather data prepared in NetCDF.  They are heavily leveraged for use by the climate modeling community with the [CMIP data specifications](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/Guide/dataUsers.html#2-model-output-specifications).  The obs4MIPs data specifications have been technically aligned with the CMIP standard output.    

See the [CF data conventions homepage](https://cfconventions.org) for more information.
