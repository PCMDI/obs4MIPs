CMOR was originally developed to help modeling groups contributing to CMIP to prepare simulations in accordance with the CMIP data conventions. In preparation for CMIP6, the latest version (CMOR3) was improved to enable gridded observations to also be prepared with CMOR. Current information about CMOR is available at https://cmor.llnl.gov/
