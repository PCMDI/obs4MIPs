* WORK IN PROGRESS * 

The first step in version control and preparation of a new obs4MIPs compliant dataset is to establish an obs4MIPs source_id.  Curation of obs4MIPs source_id is managed [via a gitHub repository](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables).  A sample of curated source_ids is [shown here](https://github.com/PCMDI/obs4MIPs-cmor-tables/blob/master/obs4MIPs_source_id.json).
