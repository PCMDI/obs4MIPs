## The obs4MIPs data specifications

The obs4MIPs data specifications (ODS) provide the detailed technical alignment between CMIP standard model output and obs4MIPs-compliant products. [ODS2.1](docs/ODSv2p1.pdf) has been used to prepare obs4MIPs-compliant datasets during much of the evaluation stage of CMIP6.  

Currently, an updated version of ODS is being developed to improve the transparency of dataset preparation.  Comments are welcome (obs4MIPs-admin@llnl.gov) on [this draft](docs/Obs4MIPsDataSpecifications2.5_NEARFINAL-noedits.pdf), which is expected to be finalized in early 2024.
