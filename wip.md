# WGCM Infrastructure Panel (WIP) 

CMIP is is led by the WCRP's [Working Group on Coupled Modeling (WGCM)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-overview).  Under the guidance of the WGCM, all CMIP activities are overseen by a coordinated pair of subcommittees: the CMIP Panel and the [WGCM Infrastructure Panel (WIP)](https://wcrp-cmip.github.io/WGCM_Infrastructure_Panel).  The technical alignment of obs4MIPs and CMIP is maintained via close coordination between the obs4MIPs steering group and the WIP.
